    Working plan

1. Decode torrent file to get tracker ip
    torrent struct
        attributes:
            []SHA-1 hashes for each piece
            bitarray, each bit tells whether i have the corresponding piece of the torrent
            
2. Send get request to tracker to get peer information 

3. Receive response from tracker which has ip addresses of peers

4. Send Handshake messages to each peer  //https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#Handshake
    receive handshake messages from peers (check peer-id from tracker (if there is one) with the one received - if different then close connection)
    
5. Peers send many Have requests, one for each piece each one has, or a bitfield
    - peer struct - to store info for each peer i am connected to; 
        attrbutes: 
            bitarray for available parts
            ip addr
            port
            ...
            
6. Send peers Interested messages in order to receive anything and wait for Unchoke message

7. One piece is too big => divide it into blocks (sizeof(block) == 2^14 == 16384 bytes)

8. Send Request messages
    4 byte message length
    1 byte message id
    payload:
    4 byte piece index (0 based)
    4 byte block offset within the piece (in bytes)
    4 byte block length (2^14)
    
9. Peers respond with Piece messages (each one contains information about a block!)
    4 byte length prefix
    1 byte message id
    payload:
    4 byte piece index
    4 byte block offset within the piece (in bytes)
    variable length block with raw bytes of the requested block (length == requested length)
    
10. Store blocks in memory until having a whole piece

11. Hash check the piece   
    11.a. if okay -> write piece to memory
    11.b. if !okay -> ask pieces again

notes:
    1. Single file - pieces will be downloaded in the following order:
        0 -> 10 -> 20 -> ... -> 1 -> 11 -> 21 -> ...
        create file in the beginning of the downloading with the needed size and writing each piece where it is supposed to be
    2. Multiple files - download file by file, for each one using the above algorithm
